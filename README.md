Handwritten Math Solver

An AI-powered system that can read "handwritten mathematical equations" from an image, recognize the symbols, parse the expression, and solve it automatically.  

Features
- Preprocessing with **OpenCV** (denoise, thresholding, segmentation).  
- **CNN-based Symbol Recognition** (digits, operators, variables).  
- Equation parsing into a valid math string (e.g., `x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0`).  
- Solving using **SymPy** (supports algebraic equations).  
- Simple web-app interface built with **Streamlit**.
